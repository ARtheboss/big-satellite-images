# big-satellite-images
Use this python bot to generate large and high quality satellite images from Google Maps


This program will work best on 13' Macs, although larger computers are also fine. This is how you use the program:

1) Find the top left corner of the image you want to genarate and zoom to the desired quality on Google Maps. This works best with labels    turned off with map in Google Map's 2D satellite view. 

2) Open a terminal window and full-screen it. Also full-screen the Google Maps tab. Display these two tabs together via OSX's multi-          tasking feature.

3) Run the script in terminal and follow instructions. Please don't move the mouse while the bot is functioning

4) The final image should be present in your computer and called 'final.png'
